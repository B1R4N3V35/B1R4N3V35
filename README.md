# Hi, I'm Bira Neves! 🖖🏻👨🏻‍💻

I've been a self-taught developer 💻 since the 1980s. This era of intense technological evolution allowed me to refine my skills in the field of software development, which has been a fundamental part of my life. However, my background is quite diverse. In addition to programming, I'm also a Biologist 🧬 and a science teacher 👨‍🔬. This combination has granted me extensive experience in the educational realm, where I've been actively involved for a significant period.

Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science 🎓. Beyond my academic commitments, I work in pedagogical consultancy leadership at an innovative company named [Geekie](https://geekie.com.br). I take great pride in being part of this movement that aims to revolutionize Education in Brazil 🇧🇷, adding technology and innovation 💡 to learning processes.

Furthermore, I am an enthusiast of free and open-source software 💾, valuing the freedom of speech 🗣️ and knowledge exchange they provide. However, I maintain a balanced stance, devoid of prejudices against proprietary solutions, understanding that each system holds its own value and specific applications.
