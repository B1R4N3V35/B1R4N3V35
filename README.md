# Hi, I'm B1R4N3V35! 🖖🏻👨🏻‍💻

I'm a self taught developer since the 1980s. Software development is a very important part in my life, but I'm also a Biologist 🧬 and a Science Teacher 👨🏻‍🏫. I've been involved with Education for a long, long time.

At present, I'm a Bachelor degree student in **Information Systems** at EACH-USP, São Paulo, Brazil. Beside that, I work in the commercial department of an awesome company - Geekie, and I'm proud to be part of this movement that intends to change Education in Brazil.

I'm also an enthusiast about free (as in "free speech"), open-source, software, but I don't have any kind of prejudice against proprietary solutions.
